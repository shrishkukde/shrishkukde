## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shrish Vijay Kukde 


I'm an Android Developer.  
I'm passionate about my work and currently work at Capgemini.  
  
When I'm not working, you can find me playing guitar, singing songs and spending time with my family and friends !  
I have a passion for learning and love sharing my knowledge with others.
