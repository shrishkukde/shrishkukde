## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shrish Vijay Kukde 


I'm an Android Developer and I'm very passionate about my work.  
I currently work at Capgemini.  
When I'm not working, you can find me playing guitar, singing songs and spending time with my family and friends !  
I have a passion for learning and love sharing my knowledge with others.  
In case you need any help related to Android Development, then please feel free to post your questions and queries [here](https://github.com/shrishkukde/shrishkukde/issues/new/choose).

## My Digital Garden: :evergreen_tree: :sunflower:  
I learn regularly through Google's Codelab and other resources available online.  
I publish my practice projects to the [repository](https://github.com/shrishkukde?tab=repositories) along with official links to codelabs, documents, cheat-sheets and helpful resources.  
This way people who visit my profile can also learn new features from the projects I upload to the repository and they too can implement those features in their own personal projects.  
Sharing is caring :heart:
